Hi, I am an experienced Chinese translator, interested in all modern technologies, like Ruby/Rails, Cocoa/Objective-C, Python and Laravel.

Here are some books I translated:

- [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://railstutorial-china.org/ "Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl")
- [Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec-cn "Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec by Aaron Sumner")
- [Learning Laravel: The Easiest Way](https://leanpub.com/learninglaravel-cn "Learning Laravel by Jack Vo")

If you have books or documentations about cool technology need translating into Chinese, please feel free to contact me at <andor.chen.27@gmail.com>.
