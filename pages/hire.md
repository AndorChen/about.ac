Hi, I am an experienced Chinese translator, focus on Ruby/Rails and Cocoa/Objective-C development.

Here are some books I translated:

- [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://railstutorial-china.org/ "Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl")
- [Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec-cn "Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec by Aaron Sumner")

If you have Ruby/Rails or Cocoa/Objective-C related books or documentations need translating into Chinese, please feel free to contact me at <andor.chen.27@gmail.com>.
